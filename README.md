This repository contains homework I did for the various data science classes I took. The code is released under the MIT License, Expat License variety. 
Typically, the projects are not fixed after grading, or even before fixing bugs during the pre-grading frenzy. So, if you use it and it breaks something on your side, you only get to keep both parts.
